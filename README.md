This Rails API allows you to access an API to be consumed by the BreakoutX application.

Allows users to incorporate a coin feature to create virtual arcades in Swift 3.

**An api key must be created and incorporated in the Swift app to properly connect the API. There is a model for the key in the models folder of the Rails app.
